## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
```

```{r}
data = read.csv("Copy of DK Milly CSV - Sheet1.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

# Convert data to long format for easier manipulation
data_long <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Team", values_to = "Player")

# Function to count combinations of a given size
count_combinations <- function(player_list, size) {
  if (length(player_list) < size) return(NULL)  # Not enough players to form a combination
  
  # Create combinations
  player_combos <- combn(player_list, size, simplify = FALSE)
  
  # Convert list of combinations to data frame and count occurrences
  combo_counts <- data.frame(Combination = sapply(player_combos, paste, collapse = ", "))
  combo_counts <- combo_counts %>%
    group_by(Combination) %>%
    summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
    arrange(desc(Count))  # Sort by count in descending order
  
  return(combo_counts)
}

# Function to get counts for combinations within a single team
get_team_combinations <- function(team_data, size) {
  players <- team_data$Player
  if (length(players) < size) return(NULL)
  
  combo_counts <- count_combinations(players, size)
  return(combo_counts)
}

# Calculate combinations of 2 and 3 players
combinations_2 <- data_long %>%
  group_by(Team) %>%
  group_split() %>%
  map_df(~ get_team_combinations(., 2)) %>%
  group_by(Combination) %>%
  summarise(Count = sum(Count), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(Count))

combinations_3 <- data_long %>%
  group_by(Team) %>%
  group_split() %>%
  map_df(~ get_team_combinations(., 3)) %>%
  group_by(Combination) %>%
  summarise(Count = sum(Count), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(Count))

# Save the results to CSV files
write.csv(combinations_2, "combinations_2.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(combinations_3, "combinations_3.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Print results (optional)
print(combinations_2)
print(combinations_3)

```
```{r}
print(data_long)

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
